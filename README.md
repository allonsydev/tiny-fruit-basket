# 🍉 A tiny fruit basket
This is a tiny _fruity_ project, heh. I'm in the early stages of learning JavaScript, so I thought doing little silly projects like this one would help me learn better.


## 🍒 The idea
Starting with basket as an empty object, fruit names _(key/property)_ and amounts _(key/property values)_ are prompted and then stored.


If the first prompt is cancelled or ESC'd, further prompting is cancelled and no object is created.
